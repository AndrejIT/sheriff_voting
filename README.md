sheriff_voting
===========

Mod for Minetest game. Allow players to vote for someone to gain additional powers in order to fight ewil.

"Voting table" block can be placed and configured with specified player name.
Players can vote to promote or to demote. Candidate becomes "sheriff" when he collects enough votes.
Sheriff is able to use several commands, depending on their vote count: /mute /unmute /jail /kicks
Votes are cast "by IP" and assigned "by name". Players can vote for multiple sheriffs at the same time.

To wote, players need to pay gold ingot. That requirement is 
to make it harder for griefers to become sheriffs.
